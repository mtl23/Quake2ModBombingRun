# Quake2ModBombingRun
A mod to quake 2 using the game source code as well as the already established ctf mod. This game spawns a bomb in the middle of multiplayer maps that players can score points with by taking it to the enemy flag-post. There are also no projectile weapons, and players must use melee weapons instead.

Open the sln file an dbuild the project, ut should give you a dll file. replace that dll to play the bombing run mode. The quake 2 ctf mod needs to already be workng and loaded properly before adding this mod to the system.
